                <h2>Background/Objectives</h2>
                    <p>Malnutrition is a prevalent problem in patients with cancer and is associated with poor prognosis. The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) recommends the provision of nutritional support and evaluation. This study aims to describe the nutritional management of patients with cancer, including assessment of adherence, from the perspective of both patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs).

                    <h2>Subjects/Methods
                        A cross-sectional descriptive observational study was carried out through two surveys addressed to patients and HCPs.

                    <h2>Results
                        A total of 230 cancer patients and 461 HCPs completed the questionnaire. The survey found 55.0% of patients experienced eating problems during treatment and 64.0% reported sequelae affecting nourishment. However, 60.1% of patients and 42.6% of HCPs indicated that nutritional status is not generally assessed. While 86.6% of HCPs stated that nutritional information is provided to patients, only 33.5% of patients reported having received it. Regarding nutritional adherence, 87.4% of HCPs stated that it is assessed whereas only 49.2% of patients receiving nutritional supplements confirmed this. General discomfort or gastrointestinal problems were the main issues hampering correct adherence perceived by both patients (41.8%) and HCPs (95.4%).

                    <h2>Conclusions
                        Our study demonstrate that different perceptions exist between patients and HCPs about nutritional management in cancer and suggests that in Spain nutritional approach is suboptimal in terms of screening/assessment of malnutrition, nutritional information provided to the patient, nutritional intervention and assessment of adherence to nutritional support. Therefore, measure should be taken to foster the adoption of ESPEN recommendations in clinical practice and to promote nutritional education of HCPs.
